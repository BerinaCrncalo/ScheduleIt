ABSTRACT

ScheduleIt is a flexible and user-friendly planning app created to
make organizing personal and work schedules easier. Through
thorough research, analysis, and teamwork, we intended to develop a
solution that addresses users’ main challenges, like complicated
interfaces, insufficient customization, and unnecessary features.
This document provides a clear overview of our development process,
including user research, idea generation, and design implementation.
The first steps included outlining user profiles, pinpointing essential
features, and defining functional and non-functional needs.
Wireframing was done using Balsamiq, allowing us to create simple
representations of the app’s layout and organization. In the
prototyping phase, Figma was used to realize the design, emphasizing
interactive elements, navigation, and realistic user experiences.
The project focuses on a user-friendly interface, main features like
task lists, reminders, calendar views, and offline usage, as well as
advanced tools such as AI support and mindfulness resources.
Informed by user input, the app includes careful design choices, such
as a soothing color scheme and adaptable layouts, to guarantee
accessibility and usability on various devices.
This document outlines our path from idea to a working prototype,
explaining the steps taken to develop a practical, engaging, and easy
to-use planning app that seeks to boost productivity and encourage a
balanced, stress-free lifestyle.
